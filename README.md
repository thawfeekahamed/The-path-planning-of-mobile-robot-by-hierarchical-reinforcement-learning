# The path planning of mobile robot by hierarchical reinforcement-learning üöÄ  

### Project Overview  
This repository contains the source code, hardware schematics, and documentation for an **autonomous mobile robot** designed to **mitigate infection transmission in healthcare environments**.  

By leveraging **Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL)**, the robot autonomously navigates **complex, dynamic environments** (such as hospital wards) to deliver essential items like food and medicine directly to patients‚Äô beds ‚Äî minimizing physical interaction between patients and nursing staff during infectious outbreaks.  

This project was developed as part of the **Final Year Interim Report** for the **Bachelor of Science in Engineering (Electronics & Telecommunication)** at **Sri Lanka Technological Campus (SLTC)**.

## üß† Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) Approach  

The HRL framework divides the robot‚Äôs overall ‚Äúdelivery‚Äù task into smaller, structured phases for faster learning and adaptability:

### **Phase 1: Static Obstacle Identification & Avoidance**
- **Goal:** Establish safe mobility in a static environment.  
- **Mechanism:** Uses ultrasonic sensors and HRL-based rules to detect, stop, and avoid obstacles.

### **Phase 2: Shortest Path Planning (Static Environment)**
- **Goal:** Optimize travel path for minimal distance and time.  
- **Mechanism:** Integrates Zigbee-based position tracking and HRL policies for efficient navigation.

### **Phase 3: Dynamic Environment Navigation**
- **Goal:** Handle moving obstacles and sudden changes in real-time.  
- **Mechanism:** A 5MP camera captures dynamic scenes while the HRL model, enhanced with the **Simulated Annealing Algorithm**, computes optimal paths instantly.
